# Accommodation System Implementation

This document explains how to set up and use the accommodation system in your trip planning application.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Run the SQL Script
Execute the `ACCOMMODATION_SETUP.sql` script in your Supabase database to create the necessary tables and policies:

```sql
-- This will create:
-- - trip_accommodations table (links trips with accommodations)
-- - Indexes for performance
-- - RLS policies for security
-- - Sample accommodation data
```

### 2. Verify Tables Exist
Ensure these tables are created in your database:
- `accommodations` - stores accommodation information
- `trip_accommodations` - links trips with specific accommodations

## üè® Accommodation Data Structure

### Accommodations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.accommodations (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT extensions.uuid_generate_v4(),
  city_id uuid NULL,
  provider text NULL,
  name text NULL,
  price_per_night numeric(12, 2) NULL,
  currency text NULL DEFAULT 'USD'::text,
  currency_id uuid NULL,
  metadata jsonb NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Trip Accommodations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.trip_accommodations (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT extensions.uuid_generate_v4(),
  trip_id uuid NOT NULL,
  accommodation_id uuid NOT NULL,
  check_in_date date NOT NULL,
  check_out_date date NOT NULL,
  notes text NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

## üöß Prerequisites

### Before Using Accommodations
1. **Cities must be added** to the trip first
2. **Accommodation data** must exist in the database for those cities
3. **User must have permission** to edit the trip

### Database Requirements
- `cities` table with city data
- `accommodations` table with accommodation data
- `trips` table with trip information
- Proper RLS policies enabled

## üîÑ Future Enhancements
