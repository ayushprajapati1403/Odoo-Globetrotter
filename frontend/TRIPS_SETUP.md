# üöÄ MyTrips Setup Guide

## Overview
The MyTrips page has been completely transformed to work with Supabase, providing a dynamic trip management system with real-time data, user roles, and collaborative features.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Run the Database Script
Copy and paste the contents of `database_setup.sql` into your Supabase SQL editor and run it. This will create:

- **`trips`** table - Stores trip information
- **`user_trips`** table - Manages user access and roles to trips
- **Indexes** for optimal performance
- **Triggers** for automatic timestamp updates
- **RLS Policies** for security

### 2. Table Structure

#### Trips Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.trips (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  start_date date,
  end_date date,
  is_public boolean DEFAULT false,
  cover_photo_url text,
  currency text DEFAULT 'USD',
  total_estimated_cost numeric(12, 2),
  metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  deleted boolean DEFAULT false
);
```

#### User Trips Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user_trips (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  trip_id uuid REFERENCES trips(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role text CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'editor', 'viewer')),
  invited_by uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  last_modified_by uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  last_modified_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(trip_id, user_id)
);
```

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see trips they own or have access to
- Trip owners have full control (create, read, update, delete)
- Editors can modify trip content

### User Roles
- **Owner**: Full control over the trip
- **Editor**: Can modify trip content and details
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to trip information

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Trip Management
- Real-time data fetching from Supabase
- Automatic updates when trips are created/modified
- Soft delete with confirmation modal

### 2. Advanced Filtering & Sorting
- Search by trip name or description
- Filter by: All, Upcoming, Past, Public, Private
- Sort by: Start date, creation date, cost, name

### 3. Trip Creation
- Comprehensive form with all required fields
- Cover photo URL support
- Budget estimation with currency selection
- Privacy settings (public/private)
- Automatic user role assignment as 'owner'

### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Beautiful card-based layout

## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

### Data Flow
1. Component mounts ‚Üí Fetch user_trips for current user
2. Extract trip IDs ‚Üí Fetch full trip details
3. Apply filters and sorting ‚Üí Render trip cards
4. User interactions ‚Üí Update database ‚Üí Refresh local state

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Loading states for all async operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No trips found" message**
   - Check if user is authenticated
   - Verify database tables exist
   - Check RLS policies are enabled

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Verify user authentication status
   - Check user_trips table entries

3. **Trips not updating**
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify real-time subscriptions
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection in Network tab
3. Test database queries in Supabase SQL editor
4. Check RLS policies are active

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

**Note**: Make sure your Supabase project has the correct environment variables set up in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
